     <h2>What is coding?</h2>
<p>
Coding is the process of writing instructions, using specific programming languages, that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are used to create software applications, build websites, automate tasks, and power countless other technologies we use every day, including mobile apps and many more.
</p>
    <h2>Coding in Nagaland</h2>
<p>
For most people in Nagaland, coding is a pretty new idea, and it's not something you see or hear about every day. It's not yet a common skill that many people have learned. But even though it's new, I'm pretty sure that there are some people right here in Nagaland who are already very skilled at coding and know a lot about it.
</p>
<p>
When you're learning to code or working on coding projects, you'll find that sometimes it can be really frustrating. You might get stuck on a problem for a long time. But then, when you finally figure it out and your code works, it feels really good and rewarding. Because it can be tough sometimes, it's really helpful to have a <span style="color: red;">Friend</span>,<span style="color: red;">Companion</span>, or <span style="color: red;">Environment</span> of people  who is also interested in coding.
</p>
<center><img src="coding.jpg" alt="coding" id="specialImage" style="height: 60%; width: 80%; border-radius: 10%;"/><br></center>
<p>
This way, you can share what you're learning, talk about the problems you're facing, and celebrate your successes together. Having someone to share this journey with can make it much easier and more enjoyable.
</p>
<p>
Hence I'm trying to built a common platform do keep our coding alive and draw new coders.
</p><br>
    <h2>Challenges For The Coders</h2>
<p>
It's not always easy to be a coder in Nagaland right now. One of the big problems is that sometimes the technology we need isn't as good or as easily available as in other places. Also, not everyone around us might really understand what coding is or why it's important. This can make things a bit difficult for people who are excited about programming.
<br><br>
Because of these challenges, coders here might sometimes feel like they are working alone and that there aren't many others who share their passion. But we recognize this need for connection and support, and we want to do something about it. We are creating a place where we can all come together to deal with these problems directly. We plan to share helpful learning materials, work through technical issues as a team, and give each other the motivation we need to grow and succeed in coding.
<br>
<center><img src="chal.jpg" alt="challenges" id="specialImage" style="height: 60%; width: 80%; border-radius: 10%;"/></center><br>
If we come together as a community, we can change how people in Nagaland think about coding. We can build a place where coders feel supported, have access to better technology, and can really thrive. By working together, we can make a big difference and create a stronger future for coding here.
